Example for a chat program in java.

Start
-----

You need at least one instance of `Server` and two of `Client` in order to try
it out.

With IntelliJ open the project. Select the `Server` class and hit `Shift`+`Alt`+`F10`, or select
**Run** ==> **Run...** from the menu. Do the same with the `Client`-class. Once you have created
run configarations (by using `Alt` or selecting **Run...**) you can 
start the client or server directly by selecting those configurations from the run menu or hitting
`Shift`+`F10` or choosing **Run** ==> **Run (Server|Client)**.

If you test this on a local machine fill in `127.0.0.1` as the IP-adress in all open clients and
choose an arbitrary name.
